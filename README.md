# Multi-threaded-Parallel-Loader
Joshua Tanner
Media Design School 2016

This program uses multithreading to simultaneously load bitmaps and sounds.
To load bitmaps select Load Images from the menu and select however many
you want. The images will arrange themselves accordingly. To play multiple 
sounds at once, simply select all the WAV files you want by clicking Load 
Sounds. 

The loader will never create more threads than is supported by the hardware. 

The user can continue to load new images and these will replace the previously
loaded ones.
